# Best-neighbourhoods-to-settle-in-Toronto

In 2019, Canada had the eighth largest immigrant population, with 35 percent settling in Toronto. Toronto is divided into 140 distinct districts. In this project, I will analyse and classify Toronto neighbourhoods based on their desirability using Machine Learning and Data Visualization.

## Methodology

Metrics to be considered when grouping neighbourhoods include: 
- The total number of important venues in each neighbourhood. 
- Additional metrics: The crime rate, total population, unemployment rate, and Pakistani population in each neighbourhood are the primary metrics. Meanwhile, housing rents will be considered as a secondary metric.
