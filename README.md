# Best-neighbourhoods-to-settle-in-Toronto

In 2019, Canada had the eighth largest immigrant population, with 35 percent settling in Toronto. Toronto is divided into 140 distinct districts. In this project, I will analyse and classify Toronto neighbourhoods based on their desirability using Machine Learning and Data Visualization.

## Methodology

Metrics to be considered when grouping neighbourhoods include: 
- The total number of important venues in each neighbourhood. 
- Additional metrics: The crime rate, total population, unemployment rate, and Pakistani population in each neighbourhood are the primary metrics. Meanwhile, housing rents will be considered as a secondary metric.

#### Analyzing Results
<b>Most Desirable Neighbourhoods:</b> These neighbourhoods should be considered if you are looking for less expensive apartments as well as a low crime and unemployment rate. Some of the most desirable neighbourhoods in Toronto are: Banbury-Don Mills, Etobicoke West Mall, Runnymede-Bloor West Village etc.

Desirable Neighbourhoods with large number of venues : Greenwood-Coxell is the only neighbourhood with a large number of venues while also having a low crime and unemployment rate. Furthermore, the rent in this area is also under $1700.

Neighbourhoods with a large amount of venues: Only 5% of Toronto neighbourhoods have high venue, with the majority of them having either a high crime rate or a high unemployment rate with the exception of Greenwood-Coxell. Some of these neighbourhoods are: Agincourt South-Malvern West, Flemingdon Park, Thistletown-Beaumond Heights etc.

Least Desirable Neighbourhoods: Avoid these neighbourhoods if possible because of high rates of crime and unemployment. Almost 50% of the neighbourhoods lie in this category.
